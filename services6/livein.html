			<p id="subDescription" style="font-size: 100%;">We've got you covered if you're looking for an online livein helper! 

				Our goal is to give our clients peace of mind knowing that whatever they need is taken care of by our team of professionals who are Experienced and certified to provide the highest level of customer service possible.
				
				So many of us have found ourselves in a bind when we need someone to help around the house, and we can't be bothered with the hassle of going out and hiring someone.<br><br> The thought of having strangers enter our homes makes us nervous, and we don't know how much they'll cost or how reliable they will be.
				
				But that's no longer a concern for you! You can hire seasoned housekeepers through our online maid service for little to no money to come in and take care of your home. You can even set up recurring payments to ensure you never need to be concerned about looking for work again when one arises.</p>
